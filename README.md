EZ tools to help make your app accessible.

## Description

This is a library of utility classes and methods to help you develop accessible Android apps.

It contains a set of accessibility-related classes that are common to our projects:

- `AccessibilityServices` - check which services are currently enabled, by type (e.g. spoken feedback)
- `Actions` - an abstraction around actions that can be performed on a UI element to implement custom accessibility actions

## Adding to your project

To start using this library, add these lines to the `build.gradle` of your project:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.novoda:accessibilitools:<latest-version>'
}
```
